<h1>How to install<h1>
<p>
To run the app (Instructions unclear: assuming the task is to explain how to run and install a dev server on VScode)
  Download VScode and Node.js.
    For Node.js, choose the latest lts version, and install npm with it.
  Now download the entire file git directory.

  Open the folder in VScode

  Now, with the folder open, open a new terminal.
    Type -    npm run dev
    This will prompt you with a link to the server which you can copy and paste into your browser of choice.
  
  Enjoy!!
